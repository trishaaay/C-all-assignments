//13.	No income tax is to be paid if income is less than 5000. If income is between 5000 and 6000 then tax is 10% of the amount by which the income exceeds 5000. If income is between 6000 and 15000 then the tax is 100 + 20% of the amount by which the income exceeds 6000. If income is more than 15000 then the tax is 1900 + 30% of the amount by which the income exceeds 15000. e.g. if income is 10000 then the tax will be 100 + (10000-6000)*20/100 = 900. Write a program, which reads income and calculates the income tax.  
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    float income, tax = 0;
    printf("Enter your income: ");
    scanf("%f", &income);
    if (income < 5000) {
        tax = 0;
    }
    else if (income <= 6000) {
        tax = (income - 5000) * 0.10;
    }
    else if (income <= 15000) {
        tax = 100 + (income - 6000) * 0.20;
    }
    else {
        tax = 1900 + (income - 15000) * 0.30;
    }
    printf("Income tax to be paid: Rs. %.2f\n", tax);
    return 0;
}
